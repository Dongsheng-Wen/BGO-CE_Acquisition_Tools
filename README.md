# BGO-CE_Acquisition_Tools
This tool is developed to faciliate the search of convex hull of multi-component systems using the Bayesian-optimized cluster expansion models. The theoretical framework is formulated in our paper [Bayesian optimization acquisition functions for accelerated search of cluster expansion convex hull of multi-component alloys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01391-7). 

The tool contains a series of acquisition functions based on the predicted energies and uncertainties of the Bayesian-Gaussian cluster expansion models.
